# budget-your-vacay

JavaScript project where users can calculate their vacation budget.

Once the user presses the "calculate budget" button, 3 alerts pop-up asking...

1. What is your total budget?
2. What are your accomodation costs?
3. How many days does your trip last?

After answering these 3 questions, the user can see how much they can spend each day on food and fun.
